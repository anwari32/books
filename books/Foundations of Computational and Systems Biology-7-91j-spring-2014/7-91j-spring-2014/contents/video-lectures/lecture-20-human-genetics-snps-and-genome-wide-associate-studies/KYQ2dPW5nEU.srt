8
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:29,715
PROFESSOR: So everybody
ready to rock and roll today?

9
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:31,140
Or at least roll?

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,350
OK, if not rock.

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,100
Welcome back to lecture 20.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,900
On Thursday, we have a special
guest appearance just for you

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,260
from Professor Ron Weiss.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,102
He's going to be talking
about synthetic biology.

15
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:48,220
You know, on Richard
Feynman's blackboard,

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,520
when he died, was a little
statement I've always

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,340
really enjoyed that was actually
encased in a little chalk line.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,820
And it said, "What I cannot
create, I do not understand."

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,220
And so synthetic
biology is one way

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,027
to approach questions in
the biological sciences

21
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:05,610
by seeing what we
can make-- you know,

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,789
whole organisms, new
genomes, rewiring circuitry.

23
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:11,330
So I think you'll find it to be
a very interesting discussion

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,720
on Thursday.

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,170
But first, before we talk
about synthetic biology,

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,300
we have the very
exciting discussion today

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,150
on human genetics, which of
course concerns all of us.

28
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,670
And so we're going to
have an exploration today.

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,350
And you know, as I
prepared today's lecture,

30
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,110
I wanted to give you the latest
and greatest research findings.

31
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,910
So we're going to talk today
from fundamental techniques

32
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,560
to things that are very
controversial that have caused

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,300
fistfights in bars, so
I'm hopeful that you'll

34
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,310
be as engaged as the
people drinking beer are.

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,270
So we'll be turning to that
at the end of the lecture,

36
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,810
but first I wanted to tell you
about the broad narrative arc

37
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,230
once again that we're going
to be talking about today.

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,510
And we're going to
be looking at how

39
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,000
to discover human variation.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,450
We're all different, about
1 based in every 1,000.

41
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,920
And there are two different
broad approaches historically

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,639
people have used.

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,816
Microarrays for
discovering variants,

44
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,690
and we'll talk about
how those were designed.

45
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,926
And we'll talk about
how to actually test

46
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,550
for the significance
of human variation

47
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,930
with respect to a particular
disease in a case and control

48
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,890
study.

49
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,530
And then we'll talk about how
to use whole genome read data

50
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,750
to detect variation
between humans

51
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,610
and some of the
challenges in that,

52
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,870
because it does not
make as many assumptions

53
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,230
as the microarray studies,
and therefore is much, much

54
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,220
more complicated to process.

55
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,930
And so we're going to
take a view into the best

56
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,280
practices of processing
human read data

57
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
so you can understand what
the state of the art is.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,450
And then we're going to
turn to a study showing

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,090
how we can bring together
different threads we've

60
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,170
talked about in this subject.

61
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,440
In particular, we've
talked about the idea

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,090
that we can use other genomic
signals such as histone marks

63
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,860
to identify things like
regulatory elements.

64
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,470
So we're going to talk about
how we can take that lens

65
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,610
and focus it on the
genome to discover

66
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,770
particular genomic variants that
have been revealed to be very

67
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,700
important in a
particular disease.

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,500
And finally, we'll
talk about the idea

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,900
that what-- the beginning
we're going to talk about today

70
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,950
is all about correlation.

71
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,280
And as all of you go forward
in your scientific career,

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,170
I'm hopeful that you'll always
be careful to not confuse

73
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,630
association or correlation
with causation.

74
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,424
You're always respected
when you clearly

75
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,840
articulate the difference when
you're giving a talk saying

76
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,670
that this is correlated,
but we don't necessarily

77
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,490
know it's causative until we do
the right set of experiments.

78
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,917
OK, on that note, we'll turn
to the computational approaches

79
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,000
we're going to talk about.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,920
We'll talk about contingency
tables and various ways

81
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,210
of thinking about
them when we discuss

82
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,710
how to identify whether or not
a particular SNP is associated

83
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,500
with a disease using
various kinds of tests.

84
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,269
And then we talk
about read data,

85
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,170
and we'll talk about
likelihood based tests.

86
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,830
How to do things like
take a population

87
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,540
of individuals and
their read data

88
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,900
and estimate the
genotypic frequencies

89
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,410
at a particular
locus using that data

90
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,660
in toto using EM
based techniques.

91
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,670
OK?

92
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,740
So let us begin then.

93
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Some of the things we're
not going to talk about

94
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,470
include non-random
genotyping failure,

95
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,410
methods to correct for
population stratification,

96
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,880
and structural variants
and copy number variations.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,480
Point three we'll
just briefly touch on,

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,910
but fundamentally they're
just embellishments

99
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,360
on the fundamental techniques
we're talking about,

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,170
and so I didn't really want
to confuse today's discussion.

101
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,300
Now a Mendelian
disorder is a disorder

102
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,250
defined by a single gene,
and therefore, they're

103
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,930
relatively easy to map.

104
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,060
And they also tend to
be in low frequency

105
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,220
in the population because
they're selected against,

106
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,290
especially the more severe
Mendelian disorders.

107
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,210
And therefore, they correspond
to very rare mutations

108
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,100
in the population.

109
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,460
By point of contrast, if you
thought about the genetics

110
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,802
we discussed last
time, if you think

111
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:42,260
about a trait that
actually perhaps

112
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,410
is influenced by 200 genes and
maybe that one of those genes

113
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,140
is not necessary or sufficient
for a particular disease.

114
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,340
As a consequence, it could
be a fairly common variant

115
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,030
and it's only if you're unlucky
enough to get all the other 199

116
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,720
variants will you actually
come down with that syndrome.

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,380
And therefore, you can see
that the effect of variation

118
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,210
in the human genome
is inversely related

119
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,660
to its frequency-- that
fairly rare variants can have

120
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,990
very serious effects, whereas
fairly common variants tend

121
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,220
to have fewer effects.

122
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,360
And in the first phase of
mapping human variation,

123
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
people thought that
common variants

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,030
were things that had
an allelic frequency

125
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,980
in the population
of 5% or greater.

126
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,940
And then to burrow down deeper,
the 1000 Genomes Project

127
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,220
surveyed a collection of
different populations.

128
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,930
And therefore, if you
thought that a variant was

129
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,800
prevalent in the
population at frequency

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,840
of 0.5%, how many people
would have in the 1000 Genomes

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,620
Project roughly?

132
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,140
Just make sure among you
we're phase-locked here.

133
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,630
0.5%, 1,000 people--

134
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,130
AUDIENCE: 5.

135
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,100
PROFESSOR: 5, great.

136
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,070
OK.

137
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,930
Good.

138
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,530
Now of course, these are three
different populations or more,

139
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,430
and so it might be that,
in fact, that variant's

140
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,120
only present in one
of the population.

141
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,661
So it just might be
one or two people

142
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:13,170
that actually have a
particular variant.

143
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:19,320
So the idea is that the way that
you design SNP chips to detect

144
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,430
single nucleotide polymorphisms,
otherwise known as "SNPs,"

145
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,110
is that you do these
population-based sequencing

146
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,790
studies and you
design the array based

147
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,880
upon all of the common
variants that you find, OK?

148
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,300
And therefore, the array
gives you a direct readout

149
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,790
in terms of the
variation, in terms

150
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,920
of all of these common variants.

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,810
That's where we'll start today.

152
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,540
And where we'll end today is
sequencing based approaches,

153
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,800
which make no assumptions
whatsoever and just all hell

154
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,310
breaks loose.

155
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,640
So you'll see what happens, OK?

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,050
But I wanted just to
reinforce the idea

157
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,970
that there are different
allelic frequencies of variants

158
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,630
and that as we get down to
rarer and rarer alleles, right,

159
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,670
we have larger effects.

160
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,300
But these higher
frequency alleles

161
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,810
could also have effects even
though they're much smaller.

162
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,490
OK, so let's talk about
how these variants arise

163
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,730
and what they mean in terms
of a small little cartoon.

164
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,040
So long, long ago,
in a world far,

165
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,930
far away, a mutation
occurred where

166
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,980
a base G got mutated
to a base A, OK?

167
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,510
And this was in the context of
a population of individuals--

168
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,809
all happy, smiling individuals
because they all actually

169
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:46,725
do not have a disease.

170
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,360
And our story goes,
what happens is

171
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,620
that we had yet another
generation of people who

172
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,931
are all happy, smiling because
they do not have the disease.

173
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:58,430
Right?

174
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,800
Yes, I do tell
stories at night, too.

175
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,290
And then another
mutation occurred.

176
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,660
And that mutation caused
some subset of those people

177
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,730
to get the mutation and for
them to get the disease.

178
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,700
So the original mutation was
not sufficient for people

179
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,560
to get this genetic disease.

180
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
It required a second
mutation for them

181
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,380
to get the genetic disease, OK?

182
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,093
So we got at least two
genes involved in it.

183
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,710
OK, the other thing
that we know is

184
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,870
that, in this particular
case, some of the people

185
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,750
have the disease that
don't have this mutation.

186
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,640
And therefore, this
mutation is not necessary.

187
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,700
It's neither necessary
nor sufficient.

188
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,790
Still, it is a marker of a
gene that increases risk.

189
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,540
And that's a
fundamental idea, right,

190
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,760
that you can increase
risk without being

191
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,470
necessary or sufficient to cause
a particular genetic disorder.

192
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,570
OK?

193
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,080
And so you get this association
then between genotype

194
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,580
and phenotype, and
that's what we're

195
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,220
going to go looking
for right now.

196
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,340
We're on the hunt.

197
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,360
We're going to go looking
for this relationship.

198
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,550
So in certain older
individuals-- hopefully,

199
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,620
not myself in the
future-- what happens

200
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,890
is that your maculus, which
is the center of your eye,

201
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,140
degenerates as shown here.

202
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,460
And you get this
unfortunate property

203
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,820
where you can't actually
see in the center

204
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,590
of your field of vision.

205
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,400
It's called age-related
macular degeneration.

206
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,900
So to look for the
causes of this, which

207
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,950
is known to be
genetically related,

208
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,140
the authors of the study
collected a collection--

209
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,380
a cohort, as it's called--
of these European-descent

210
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,330
individuals, all who are at
least 60 years old, to study

211
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,180
the genetic foundations
for this disorder.

212
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,950
And so they found
934 controls that

213
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:24,720
were unaffected by age-related
macular degeneration and 1,238

214
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,525
cases, and they genotyped
them all using arrays.

215
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,190
Now the question is, are
any of the identified

216
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:40,410
SNPs on the array related
to this particular disorder?

217
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,854
So I'll give you
the answer first

218
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,270
and then we'll
talk about a couple

219
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,210
of different ways of
thinking about this data, OK?

220
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,260
So here's the answer.

221
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,330
Here's a particular
SNP, rs1061170.

222
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,272
There are the individuals
with AMD and the controls.

223
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:02,730
And what you're
looking at up here,

224
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,010
these numbers are the
allelic counts, all right?

225
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,360
So each person has
how many alleles?

226
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
Two, right?

227
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,580
That's double the
number of individuals.

228
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,460
And the question is,
are the C and T alleles

229
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:24,770
associated with the cases
or controls significantly?

230
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,670
And so you can compute
a Chi-square metric

231
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,820
on this so-called
contingency table.

232
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,217
And one of the things
about contingency tables

233
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,800
that I think is
important to point out

234
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,910
is that you hear about
marginal probabilities, right?

235
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,640
And people probably
know that originally

236
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,340
derived from the
idea of these margins

237
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,390
along the side of a
contingency table, right?

238
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,490
If you think about the marginal
probability of somebody

239
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,470
having a C allele, regardless
of whether a case or control,

240
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,980
it would be 2,192
over 4,344, right?

241
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,440
So the formula for computing
the Chi-square statistic

242
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,710
is shown here.

243
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,460
It's this sort of
scary-looking polynomial.

244
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,730
And the number of
degrees of freedom is 1.

245
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,950
It's the number of rows
minus 1 times the number

246
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,880
of columns minus 1.

247
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,420
And the P-value we get is
indeed quite small-- 10

248
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,450
to the minus 62.

249
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,920
Therefore, the
chance this happened

250
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,670
at random-- even with
multiple hypothesis

251
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,240
correction, given that we're
testing a million SNPs--

252
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,600
is indeed very, very low.

253
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,680
This looks like a winner.

254
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,940
Looks like we've got a
SNP that is associated

255
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,530
with this particular disease.

256
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,110
Now just to remind you about
Chi-square statistics--

257
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,090
I'm sure people have seen this
before-- the usual formulation

258
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:50,150
is that you compute this
Chi-square polynomial

259
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,454
on the right-hand side,
which is the observed

260
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:54,870
number of something minus the
expected number of something

261
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,560
squared over the expected
number or something, right?

262
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,874
And you sum it up over
all the different cases.

263
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,790
And you can see that the
expected number of As

264
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,350
is given by the little
formula on the left.

265
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,380
Suffice to say, if you expand
that formula and manipulate it,

266
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,230
you get the equation we
had on the previous slide.

267
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,060
So it's still that fuzzy,
friendly Chi-square formula

268
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,780
you always knew, just
in a different form, OK?

269
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,150
Now is there
another way to think

270
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,140
about computing the likelihood
of seeing data in a contingency

271
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,910
table at random, right?

272
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,260
Because we're always asking,
could this just be random?

273
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,380
I mean, could this have
occurred by chance,

274
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,130
that we see the data arranged
in this particular form?

275
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,460
Well, we've another
convenient way

276
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,240
of thinking about
this, which is we could

277
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,400
do Fisher's Exact Test,
which is very related

278
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,477
to the idea of the
hypergeometric test

279
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,060
that we've talked
about before, right?

280
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,810
What are the chances we would
see exactly this arrangement?

281
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,640
Well, we would need to have,
out of a plus b C alleles,

282
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,150
we'd have 8 of them be cases,
which is the first term there

283
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,000
in that equation.

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,536
And of the T alleles, we need to
have c of them out of c plus d

285
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:23,540
be there.

286
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,260
And then we need to have a
plus b plus c plus d choose

287
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,080
a plus c-- that's the
total number of chances

288
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,290
of seeing things.

289
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,440
So this is the probability
of the arrangement

290
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,970
in the table in this
particular form.

291
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,750
Now people-- I'll let
you digest that for one

292
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,040
second before I go on.

293
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:51,380
So this is the number of ways
on the numerator of arranging

294
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,830
things to get the table
the way that we see it

295
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,280
over the total number or
ways of arranging the table,

296
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,180
keeping the marginal
totals the same.

297
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,960
Is that clear?

298
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,390
So this is the probability,
the exact probability,

299
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,080
of seeing the table
in this configuration.

300
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,555
And then what you do is you
take that probability and all

301
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:19,220
of the probabilities for all the
more extreme values, say, of a.

302
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,960
And you sum them all
up and that gives you

303
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,930
the probability of
a null hypothesis.

304
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,850
So this is another
way to approach

305
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,660
looking at the chance a
particular contingency table

306
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,160
set of values would
occur at random.

307
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,860
So if people talk about
Fisher's Exact Test-- you know,

308
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,264
tonight at that cocktail party.

309
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,430
"Oh yeah, I know about that.

310
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,680
Yeah, it's like
the hypergeometric.

311
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,410
It's no big deal."

312
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:42,880
You know?

313
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,379
Right.

314
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,930
All right.

315
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:55,390
So now let us suppose that
we do an association test

316
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,060
and you do the following design.

317
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,330
You say, well, I've
got all my cases.

318
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,663
They're all at Mass General and
I want to genotype them all.

319
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,079
And Mass General
is the best place

320
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,454
for this particular disease,
so I'm going to go up there.

321
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:12,680
I need some controls but I'm
running out of budgetary money,

322
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,974
so I'm going to do all my
controls in China, right?

323
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:18,140
Because I know it's going
to be less expensive there

324
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,990
to genotype them.

325
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,350
And furthermore--
as a little aside,

326
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,849
I was once meeting
with this guy who

327
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:30,000
is like one of the ministers
of research in China.

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,010
He came to my office.

329
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,135
I said, so what do
you do in China?

330
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,260
And he said, well, I guess
the best way to describe

331
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,990
it is that I'm in charge of the
equivalent of the NSF, DARPA,

332
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,345
and the NIH.

333
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:41,810
I said, oh.

334
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,200
I said, would like to
meet the president?

335
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,290
Because I'd be happy to
call MIT's president.

336
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,350
I'm sure they'd be
happy to meet with you.

337
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,230
He said, no.

338
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,430
He said, I like going direct.

339
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,150
So, at any rate,
I told him I was

340
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,680
working in stem cell research.

341
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,590
He said, you know, one thing I
can say about China-- in China,

342
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,370
stem cells, ethics, no problem.

343
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,350
[LAUGHTER]

344
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,510
At any rate, so you go to
China to do your controls, OK?

345
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,180
And why is that a bad
experimental design?

346
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,020
Can anybody tell me?

347
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:20,544
You do all your cases here,
you do your controls in China.

348
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:20,996
Yes?

349
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:22,454
AUDIENCE: Because
the SNPs in China

350
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:23,710
are not necessarily the same.

351
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,390
PROFESSOR: Yes.

352
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,340
The Chinese population's
going to have

353
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,193
a different set of SNPs,
right, because it's

354
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:29,392
been a contained population.

355
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:31,100
So you're going to
pick up all these SNPs

356
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,720
that you think are going to
be related to the disease that

357
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,770
are simply a consequence of
population stratification,

358
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,870
right?

359
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,990
So what you need to do
is to control for that.

360
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,030
And the way you do that is you
pick a bunch of control SNPs

361
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,570
that you think are
unrelated to a disease

362
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,560
and you do a Chi-square
test on those

363
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,950
to make sure that they're
not significant, right?

364
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,630
And methodologies for
controlling for population

365
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,650
stratification by picking
apart your individuals

366
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,861
and re-clustering
them is something

367
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,360
that is a topic of
current research.

368
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,630
And finally, the good news
about age-related macular

369
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,540
degeneration is that
there are three genes

370
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,680
with five common variants
that explain 50% of the risk.

371
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,840
And so it has been viewed as
sort of a very successful study

372
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,220
of a polygenic-- that
is, multiple gene--

373
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,240
genetic disorder that
has been dissected

374
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
using this methodology.

375
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,790
And with these genes, now
people can go after them

376
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,010
and see if they can come up
appropriate therapeutics.

377
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,340
Now using the same idea-- cases,
controls-- you look at each SNP

378
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,570
individually and you
query it for significance

379
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,470
based upon a null model.

380
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,000
You can take a wide
range of common diseases

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,380
and ask whether or
not you can detect

382
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:03,450
any genetic elements that
might influence risk.

383
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,250
And so here are a set
of different diseases,

384
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,000
starting with bipolar
disorder at the top,

385
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,740
going down to type 2
diabetes at the bottom.

386
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,220
This is a so-called
Manhattan plot,

387
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,222
because you see the buildings
along the plot, right?

388
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:18,680
And when there are
skyscrapers, you

389
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,820
go, whoa, that could be
a problem, all right?

390
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,630
And so this is the
style-- you see,

391
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,250
this came out in
2007-- of research

392
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,272
that attempts to do genome
wide scans for loci that

393
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,730
are related to
particular diseases.

394
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,500
OK, now, I'd like to go on
and talk about other ways

395
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:50,390
that these studies can
be influenced, which

396
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:58,490
is the idea of linkage
disequilibrium.

397
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:14,810
So for example, let us say that
I have a particular individual

398
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:20,470
who's going to produce a
gamete and the gamete's going

399
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,490
to be haploid, right?

400
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:30,320
And it's going have one
allele from one of these two

401
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,830
chromosomes and one allele from
one of these two chromosomes.

402
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,590
We've talked about
this before last time.

403
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,670
And there are four
possibilities--

404
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:48,520
AB, aB, Ab, and ab, OK?

405
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,820
And if this was a
coin flip, then each

406
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,570
of these genotypes
for this gamete

407
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,800
would be identical, right?

408
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,460
But let us suppose
that I tell you

409
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:10,270
that there are only two
that result-- this one, AB,

410
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,975
and the small one, ab, OK?

411
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,880
If you look at this, you
say, aha, these two things

412
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,270
are linked and they're
very closely linked.

413
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,960
And so, if they're always
inherited together,

414
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:35,550
we might think that the distance
between them on the genome

415
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,820
is small.

416
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,870
So in the human genome,
what's the average distance

417
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,950
between crossover events
during a meiotic event?

418
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,641
Does anybody know, roughly
speaking, how many bases?

419
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:50,140
Hm?

420
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,014
AUDIENCE: A megabase?

421
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:51,950
PROFESSOR: A megabase.

422
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,130
Little low.

423
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,460
How many centimorgans
long is the human genome?

424
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,211
All right?

425
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:08,150
Anybody know?

426
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,900
3,000?

427
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,676
4,000?

428
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:13,120
Something like that?

429
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,240
So maybe 50 to 100 megabases
between crossover events, OK?

430
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:28,620
So if these markers
are very closely

431
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,660
organized along the genome,
the likelihood of a crossover

432
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,930
is very small.

433
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,460
And therefore, they're going
to be in very high LD, right?

434
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:46,340
And a way to measure that is
with the following formula,

435
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,810
which is that if you link the
two locuses-- we have L1 and L2

436
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,830
here.

437
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,740
And now we're talking about
the population instead

438
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,080
of a particular individual.

439
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,740
If the likelihood of the
capital allele A is piece of A

440
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,650
and the probability
of the big B allele

441
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,434
is piece of B, then if they
were completely unlinked,

442
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:14,350
then the likelihood of
inheriting both of them

443
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,320
together with would be
piece of A times piece of B,

444
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,520
showing independence.

445
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,720
However if they
aren't independent,

446
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,340
we can come up
with a single value

447
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,150
D which allows us to quantify
the amount of disequilibrium

448
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,550
between those two alleles.

449
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,090
And the formula for D
is given on the slide.

450
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,570
And furthermore, if it's
more convenient for you

451
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,190
to think about in terms
of r-squared correlation,

452
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,420
we can define the
r-squared correlation

453
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,420
as D squared over
PA, QA, PB, QB,

454
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,660
as shown in the lower left
hand part of this slide, OK?

455
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,530
This is simply a
way of describing

456
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,490
how skewed the
probabilities are from being

457
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,360
independent for
inheriting these two

458
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,850
different loci in a population.

459
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,880
Are there any questions
at all about that,

460
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,140
the details of that?

461
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,940
OK.

462
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,800
So just to give you an example,
if you look at chromosome 22,

463
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,460
the physical distance on
the bottom is in kilobases,

464
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,910
so that's from 0 to 1
megabase on the bottom.

465
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,140
And you look at the
r-squared values,

466
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,640
you can see things that
are quite physically close,

467
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,860
as we suggested earlier,
have a high r-squared value.

468
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,360
But there are still
some things that

469
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,230
are pretty far away
that have surprisingly

470
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,505
high r-squared values.

471
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,890
There are recombination
hot spots in the genome.

472
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,690
And it's, once again, a topic
of current research trying

473
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,020
to figure out how the genome
recombines and recombination is

474
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,717
targeted.

475
00:25:56,717 --> 00:25:59,050
But suffice it to say, as you
can see, it's not uniform.

476
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,140
Now what happens as
a consequence of this

477
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,640
is that you get regions
of the genome where

478
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,060
things stick together, right?

479
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,560
They're all drinking
buddies, right?

480
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,870
They all hang out together, OK?

481
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,740
But here's what I'm going to ask
you-- how much of your genome

482
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,740
came from your dad?

483
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:22,280
Half.

484
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,762
How much came from
your dad's dad?

485
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:24,908
AUDIENCE: A quarter.

486
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:26,616
PROFESSOR: And from
your dad's dad's dad?

487
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:27,449
AUDIENCE: An eighth.

488
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,600
PROFESSOR: An eighth, OK?

489
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,730
So the amount of your genome
going back up the family tree

490
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,660
is falling off exponentially
up a particular path, right?

491
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,970
So if you think about groups
of things that came together

492
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,440
from your great,
great grandfather

493
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,910
or his great, great
grandfather, right,

494
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,159
the further back you go, the
less and less contribution

495
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,700
they're going to
have to your genome.

496
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,580
And so the blocks are
going to be smaller--

497
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,470
that is, the amount
of information

498
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,200
you're getting from
way back up the tree.

499
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,060
So if you think about
this, the question

500
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,570
of what blocks of things
are inherited together

501
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,390
is not something that you
can write an equation for.

502
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,580
It's something that you
study in a population.

503
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,860
You go out and you
ask, what things do we

504
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,390
observe coming together?

505
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,340
And generally, larger
blocks of things

506
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,760
are inherited together, occur
in more recent generations,

507
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,930
because there's less
dilution, right?

508
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,256
Whereas if you go way
back in time-- not quite

509
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:25,880
to where the dinosaurs
roamed the land,

510
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,720
but you get the idea-- the
blocks are, fact, quite small.

511
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,890
And so, the HapMap project
went about looking at blocks

512
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,700
and how they were
inherited in the genome.

513
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,430
And what suffices to know is
that they found blocks-- here

514
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,460
you can see three
different blocks.

515
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,450
And these are called
haplotype blocks

516
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,400
and the things that
are colored red

517
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,820
are high r-squared
values between

518
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,360
different genetic markers.

519
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,110
And we talked earlier
about how to compute

520
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,600
that r-squared value.

521
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,650
So those blocks typically
are inherited together.

522
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,150
Yes?

523
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,776
AUDIENCE: Are these blocks
like fuzzy boundaries?

524
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:07,580
PROFESSOR: No.

525
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,520
Well, remember in this
particular example,

526
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,910
we're only querying at
specified markers which

527
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,010
are not necessarily at regular
intervals along the genome.

528
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,660
So in this case, the blocks
don't have fuzzy boundaries.

529
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,122
As we get into
sequencing-based approaches,

530
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:25,580
they could have
fuzzier boundaries.

531
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,080
But haplotype
blocks are typically

532
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,080
thought to be discrete blocks
that are inherited, OK?

533
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,690
Good question.

534
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,523
Any other questions?

535
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,350
OK.

536
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,040
So I want to impress
upon the idea

537
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,050
that this is empirical, right?

538
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,010
There's no magic here in
terms of fundamental theory

539
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,640
about what things should
be haplotype blocks.

540
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,550
It's simply that you
look at a population

541
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,680
and you're look at what
markers are drinking buddies

542
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,750
and those make haplotype blocks
and you empirically categorize

543
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:04,220
and catalog them-- which can
be very helpful, as you'll see.

544
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,150
And thus, when we think
about genetic studies,

545
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:10,990
when we think about the
length of shared segments,

546
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,980
if you're thinking
about studying a family,

547
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,934
like a trio-- a trio is a mom,
a dad, and a child, right?

548
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:19,100
They're going to share a
lot of genetic information,

549
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,960
and so the haplotype blocks that
are shared amongst those three

550
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,390
individuals are going
to be very large indeed.

551
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,310
Whereas if you go
back generations,

552
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,090
the blocks-- like the
second cousins or things

553
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,180
like that-- the
blocks get smaller.

554
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,260
So the x-axis on this
plot is the median length

555
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,480
of a shared segment.

556
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,410
And as an association
study, which

557
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,260
is taking random people
out of the population,

558
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,154
has very small shared
blocks indeed, OK?

559
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,070
And so the techniques
that we're talking about

560
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,030
today are applicable
almost in any range,

561
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,660
but they're particularly
useful where

562
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,780
you can't depend upon
the fact that you're

563
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,250
sharing a lot of information
along the genome proximal

564
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,162
to where the marker
is that's associated

565
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:03,245
with a particular disease.

566
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,770
Now the other thing
that is true is

567
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,120
that we should note that
the fact that markers have

568
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,110
this LD associated
with them means

569
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:25,300
that it may be that a particular
marker is bang on-- what's

570
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,190
called a causative SNP.

571
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,230
Or something that,
for example, sits

572
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,650
in the middle of a gene
causing a missense mutation.

573
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,610
Or it sits right in the middle
of a protein binding site,

574
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,490
causing the factor
not to bind anymore.

575
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,320
But also it could be something
that is actually a little bit

576
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,080
away, but is highly correlated
to the causative SNP.

577
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,530
So just keep in mind that
when you have an association

578
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,930
and you're looking at a SNP, it
may not be the causative SNP.

579
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,644
It might be just linked
to the causative SNP.

580
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:00,685
And sometimes these things
are called proxy SNPs.

581
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:12,530
OK, so we've talked
about the idea of SNPs

582
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,460
and discovering them.

583
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,515
Let me ask you one more question
about where these SNPs reside

584
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:21,230
and see if you
could help me out.

585
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:38,500
OK, this is a really
important gene, OK?

586
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,920
Call it RIG for short, OK?

587
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,350
Now let us suppose that
you know that there

588
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,100
are some mutations here.

589
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,080
And my question for you is,
does it matter whether or not

590
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,410
the two mutations look
like this or the mutations

591
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:03,260
look like this, in your opinion?

592
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,470
That is, both mutations
occur in one copy

593
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,330
or on one chromosome
of the gene,

594
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,340
whereas in the other case, we
see two different SNPs that

595
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,110
are different than
reference, but they're

596
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,240
referring in both
mom and dad alleles.

597
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,391
Is there a difference
between those two cases?

598
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:28,890
Yeah?

599
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,846
AUDIENCE: In terms of
the phenotype displayed?

600
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:33,291
PROFESSOR: In terms of
the phenotype, sorry.

601
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:34,758
AUDIENCE: It depends.

602
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:35,736
PROFESSOR: It depends?

603
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:36,319
AUDIENCE: Yes.

604
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,203
PROFESSOR: OK.

605
00:32:37,203 --> 00:32:41,115
AUDIENCE: So if it causes a
recessive mutation, then no,

606
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:46,494
because other genes will
be able to rescue it.

607
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:48,161
But if it's dominant,
then it'll still--

608
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:50,077
PROFESSOR: It's actually
the other way around.

609
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:51,880
If it's recessive,
this does matter.

610
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,470
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

611
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,720
PROFESSOR: Because in this
case, with the purple ones,

612
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,240
you still have one good
copy of the gene, right?

613
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,100
However, with the
green ones, it's

614
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,310
possible that you have
ablated both good copies

615
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,680
of the gene, this
really important gene,

616
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,910
and therefore, you're
going to get a higher

617
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,280
risk of having a
genetic disorder.

618
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,430
So when you're scanning down
the genome then-- you know,

619
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,680
we've been asking where
are there differences

620
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,440
from reference or from
between cases and controls

621
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,330
down the genome, but we
haven't asked whether or not

622
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,299
they're on mom or dad, right?

623
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,715
We're just asking,
are they there?

624
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,200
But it turns out that
for questions like this,

625
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,550
we have to know whether or
not the mutation occurred

626
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,450
in only in mom's chromosome
or in both chromosomes

627
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,200
in this particular
neighborhood, all right?

628
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,060
This is called phasing
of the variants.

629
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,260
Phasing means
placing the variants

630
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:05,340
on a particular chromosome.

631
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,300
And then, by phasing
the variants,

632
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,139
you can figure out some
of the possible phenotypic

633
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,830
consequences of them.

634
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,830
Because if they're not
they phased, in this case,

635
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,844
it's going to be much less
clear what's going on.

636
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:21,219
So then the question
becomes, how

637
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,020
do we phase variants, right?

638
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,670
So phasing assigns alleles
to the parental chromosomes.

639
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,000
And so, the set of alleles along
a chromosomes is a haplotype.

640
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,980
We've talked about the
idea of haplotypes.

641
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,780
So imagine one way to phase
is that if I tell you,

642
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,880
by magic, in this population
you're looking at,

643
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,040
here are all the
haplotypes and these

644
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,610
are the only ones that exist.

645
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,590
You look in your
haplotypes and you go, aha,

646
00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:00,560
this haplotype exists but
this one does not, right?

647
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,540
That this is a haplotype--
this two purples together

648
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,310
is a haplotype, and
this green without one

649
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,555
is another haplotype.

650
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:10,690
So you see which
haplotypes exist-- that is,

651
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,370
what patterns of inheritance
of alleles along a chromosome

652
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,600
you can detect.

653
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,080
And using the established
empirical haplotypes,

654
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,190
you can phase the variants, OK?

655
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,580
Now the other way to
phase the variants

656
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,084
is much, much simpler
and much better, right?

657
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:33,500
The other way to
phase variants is

658
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,330
you just have a single read that
covers the entire thing, right?

659
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,110
And then the read, it
will be manifest, right?

660
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,230
The read will cover
the entire region

661
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,990
and then you see
the two mutations

662
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,850
in that single
region of the genome.

663
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,410
The problem we're up against
is that most of our reads

664
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:56,340
are quite short and we're
reassembling our genotypes

665
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,140
from a shattered genome.

666
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,320
If the genome wasn't
shattered, then we

667
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
wouldn't have this problem.

668
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,780
So everybody's
working to fix this.

669
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,090
Illumina has sort of a
cute trick for fixing this.

670
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,350
And PacBio, which is
another sequence instrument

671
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,970
manufacturer, can produce reads
that are tens of thousands

672
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,174
of bases long, which allows
you to directly phase

673
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:23,340
the variants from the reads.

674
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,060
But if somebody,
once again, comes up

675
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,650
to you at the cocktail party
tonight and says, you know,

676
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,250
I've never understood why
you have to phase variants.

677
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,010
You know, this is a popular
question I get all the time.

678
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,754
[LAUGHTER]

679
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:41,420
You can tell them,
hey, you know,

680
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,620
you have to know whether or
not mom and dad both have

681
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,040
got big problems or just all
the problems are with mom, OK?

682
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,450
Or dad.

683
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,680
So you can put
their mind at ease

684
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,610
as you're finishing
off the hors d'oeuvres.

685
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,240
OK, so I wanted just to tell
you about phasing variants

686
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,400
because we're about to go on to
the next part of our discussion

687
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,860
today.

688
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,030
We are leaving the very
clean and pristine world

689
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,550
of very defined SNPs,
defined by microarrays,

690
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:16,030
into the wild and woolly world
of sequencing data, right?

691
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,840
Which is all bets are off.

692
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,370
It's all raw
sequencing data and you

693
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,500
have to make sense
of it-- hundreds

694
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,430
of millions of sequencing reads.

695
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,480
So today's lecture is drawn from
a couple of different sources.

696
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,720
I've posted some of
them on the internet.

697
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,600
There's a very nice article
by Heng Li on the underlying

698
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,010
mathematics of SNP calling and
variation which I've posted.

699
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,750
In addition, some of
the material today

700
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,180
is taken from the Genome
Analysis Toolkit, which

701
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,360
is a set of tools
over at the Broad,

702
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,922
and we'll be talking about
that during today's lecture.

703
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:56,380
The best possible case when
you're looking at sequence data

704
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,000
today is that you get
something like this, all right?

705
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,340
Which is that you have
a collection of reads

706
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,370
for one individual and you
align them to the genome

707
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,380
and then you see that
some of the reads

708
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,690
have a C at a particular base
position and other of the reads

709
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,490
have a T at that base position.

710
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,660
And so it's a very
clean call, right?

711
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,980
You have a CT heterozygote
at that position-- that

712
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,240
is, whatever person that
is is a heterozygote there.

713
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,816
You can see the reference genome
at the very bottom, right?

714
00:38:29,816 --> 00:38:31,940
So it's very difficult for
you to read in the back,

715
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,750
but C is the reference allele.

716
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,570
And the way that
the IGV viewer works

717
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,140
is that it shows non-reference
alleles in color,

718
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:46,410
so all those are the T alleles
you see there in red, OK?

719
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,667
And it's very, very
beautiful, right?

720
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,500
I mean you can tell
exactly what's going on.

721
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,890
Now we don't know whether
or not the C or the T allele

722
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,827
are a mom and dad
respectively, right?

723
00:38:57,827 --> 00:38:59,910
We don't know which of the
chromosomes they're on,

724
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,340
but suffice to say,
it's very clean.

725
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,300
And the way that all of
this starts, of course,

726
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,880
is with a BAM file.

727
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,760
You guys have seen
BAM files before.

728
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,370
I'm not going to belabor this.

729
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,470
There's a definition
here and you

730
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,482
can add extra
annotations on BAM files.

731
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:18,190
But the other thing
I wanted to point out

732
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,750
is that you know that BAM
files include quality scores.

733
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,450
So we'll be using those quality
scores in our discussion.

734
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,050
The output of all
this typically is

735
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:34,320
something called a variant
call file or a VCF file.

736
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,810
And just so you are
not completely scared

737
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,990
by these files, I want to
describe just a little bit

738
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,510
about their structure.

739
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,800
So there's a header
at the top telling you

740
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,560
what you actually did.

741
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,270
And then chromosome 20 at this
base location has this SNP.

742
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,110
The reference allele is
G, the alternative allele

743
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,444
is A. This is some
of the statistics

744
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:02,110
as described by this
header information,

745
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,240
like DP is the read depth.

746
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,870
And this tells you the status
of a trio that you processed.

747
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:21,969
So this is the
allele number for one

748
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,510
of the chromosomes,
which is 0, which

749
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,610
is a G. The other one's
a G, and so forth.

750
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,657
And then this data right
here is GT, GQ, GP,

751
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:31,740
which are defined up here.

752
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,820
So you have one person,
second person, third person,

753
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,990
along with which one
of the alleles, 0 or 1,

754
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,110
they have on each of
their chromosomes, OK?

755
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,480
So this is the output.

756
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,850
You put in raw reads
and what you get out

757
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,250
is a VCF file that for
bases along the genome

758
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:55,260
calls variance, OK?

759
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,190
So that's all there
is to it, right?

760
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,530
You take in your read data.

761
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,670
You take your genome, throw
it through the sequencer.

762
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,300
You take the BAM file,
you call the variants,

763
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,900
and then you make your
medical diagnosis, right?

764
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,390
So what we're going to
talk about is what goes on

765
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,300
in the middle there,
that little step-- how

766
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,510
do you actually
call the variants?

767
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,689
And you might say, gee,
that does not seem too hard.

768
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:20,480
I mean, I looked at
the slide you showed me

769
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,970
with the CT heterozygote.

770
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,670
That looked beautiful, right?

771
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,490
I mean, that was just gorgeous.

772
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,440
I mean, these sequencers are
so great and do so many reads,

773
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,870
what can be hard
about this, after all?

774
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,310
You know, it's a quarter
to 2:00, time to go home.

775
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,170
Not quite, OK?

776
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:35,670
Not quite.

777
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:40,390
The reason is actual
data looks like this.

778
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,260
So these are all reads
aligned to the genome

779
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,134
and, as I told you
before, all the colors are

780
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,510
non-reference bases.

781
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,520
And so you can see that
the reads that come out

782
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,070
of an individual are
very messy indeed.

783
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,640
And so we need to deal with
those in a principled way.

784
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,050
We need to make good,
probabilistic assessments of

785
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,340
whether or not there's a
variant at a particular base.

786
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,400
And I'm not going to belabor
all the steps of the Genome

787
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,380
Analysis Toolkit,
suffice to say,

788
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,620
here is a flow chart of all
the steps that go through it.

789
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,920
First, you map your reads.

790
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,720
You recalibrate the scores.

791
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,120
You compress the
read set and then

792
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,950
you have read sets for
n different individuals.

793
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,430
And then you jointly call
the variants and then you

794
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,130
improve upon the variants
and then you evaluate, OK?

795
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,080
So I'll touch upon some of
the aspects of this pipeline,

796
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,090
the ones that I think
are most relevant,

797
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:41,400
so that you can appreciate
some of the complexity

798
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,232
in dealing with this.

799
00:42:43,232 --> 00:42:44,940
Let me begin with the
following question.

800
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:54,750
Let us suppose that you have
a reference genome here,

801
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,180
indicated by this line,
and you align a read to it.

802
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,705
And then there's some base
errors that are non-reference,

803
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:05,470
so it's variants calls down
at this end of the read, OK?

804
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,950
So this is the five
prime, three prime.

805
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:14,000
And then you align a read
from the opposite strand

806
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,710
and you have some variant
calls on the opposite end

807
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,660
of the read like this.

808
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:26,470
And you'll say to yourself,
what could be going on here,

809
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,420
you know?

810
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,470
Why is it that they're
not concordant, right,

811
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,310
when they're mapped, but
they're in the same region

812
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:35,910
of the genome?

813
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,910
And then you think
to yourself, well,

814
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,737
what happens if I map this
successfully here correctly

815
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:47,486
to the reference genome
and this correctly

816
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:52,010
to the reference genome here,
but this individual actually

817
00:43:52,010 --> 00:44:01,236
had a chromosome that had
a deletion right here, OK?

818
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:03,610
Then what would happen would
be that all these reads down

819
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,344
here are going to be
misaligned, all of these bases

820
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,260
are going to be misaligned
with the reference.

821
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,590
And so you're going
to get variant calls.

822
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,660
And these bases will be also
misaligned with the reference,

823
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,200
you'll get variant calls.

824
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,410
So deletions in
an individual can

825
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,160
cause things to
be mapped but you

826
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,540
get variant calls at the end.

827
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,750
And so that is shown
here, where you

828
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,620
have reads that are being mapped
and you have variant calls

829
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,330
at the end of the reads.

830
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,810
And it's also a
little suspicious

831
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:44,980
because in the middle here is
a seven-base pair homopolymer

832
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,950
which is all T's.

833
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,520
And as we know,
sequencers are notoriously

834
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,610
bad at correctly
reading homopolymers.

835
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,700
So if you then
correct things, you

836
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,470
discover that some
fraction of the reads

837
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:07,070
actually have one of the T's
missing and all the variants

838
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,890
that were present
before go away.

839
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:15,800
So this is a process
of INDEL adjustment

840
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,730
when you are mapping the
region looking for variants.

841
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:26,190
Now this does not occur we're
talking about SNP microarrays.

842
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,200
So this is a problem
that's unique to the fact

843
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,020
that we're making many
fewer assumptions when

844
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,350
we map reads to
the genome de novo.

845
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,470
The second and another
very important step

846
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:44,090
that they're very proud
of is essentially--

847
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,400
I guess how to put this
politely-- finding out

848
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,120
that manufacturers of
sequencing instruments,

849
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,162
as you know, for every
base that they give you,

850
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:52,995
they give you an estimate
of the probability

851
00:45:52,995 --> 00:45:56,240
that the base is correct--
or it's wrong, actually.

852
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,350
A so-called Phred score--
we've talked about that before.

853
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:03,080
And as you would imagine,
manufacturers' instruments

854
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,320
are sometimes optimistic,
to say the least, about

855
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,300
the quality of their scores.

856
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,310
And so they did a survey of
a whole bunch of instruments

857
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:17,002
and they plotted the reported
score against the actual score,

858
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:18,360
OK?

859
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,510
And then they have a whole
step in their pipeline

860
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:24,850
to adjust the scores, whether
you be a Solexa GA instrument,

861
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,370
a 454 instrument, a SOLiD
instrument, a HiSeq instrument,

862
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,210
or what have you.

863
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:35,210
And there is a way to adjust the
score based upon the raw score

864
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,810
and also how far down
the read you are,

865
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:39,990
as the second line shows.

866
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,240
The second line is a
function of score correction

867
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,150
versus how far down the read or
number of cycles you have gone.

868
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:53,304
And the bottom is adjustments
for dinucleotides,

869
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:54,720
because some
instruments are worse

870
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,566
a certain dinucleotides
than others.

871
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:58,940
As you can see, they're very
proud of the upper left hand

872
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,440
part.

873
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,500
This is one of the major
methodological advances

874
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,610
of 1000 Genome
Project, figuring out

875
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:11,370
how to recalibrate quality
scores for instruments.

876
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,320
Why is this so important?

877
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,290
The reason it's important
is that the estimate

878
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:23,080
of the veracity of
bases figures centrally

879
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,240
in determining whether or
not a variant is real or not.

880
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,530
So you need to have as best
an estimate as you possibly

881
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,550
can of whether or not a base
coming out of the sequencer

882
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,660
is correct, OK?

883
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,060
Now if you're doing
lots of sequencing

884
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,980
of either individuals
or exomes--

885
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,710
I should talk about exome
sequencing for a moment.

886
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,210
Up until recently,
it has not really

887
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,150
been practical to
do whole genome

888
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,580
sequencing of individuals.

889
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:00,300
That's why these SNP arrays
were originally invented.

890
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,550
Instead, people sequenced the
expressed part of the genome,

891
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,050
right?

892
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,150
All of the genes.

893
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,160
And they can do this
by capture, right?

894
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,950
They go fishing.

895
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:19,480
They create fishing poles out of
the genes that they care about

896
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,550
and they pull out the
sequences of those genes

897
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,610
and they sequence them.

898
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,310
So you're looking at a
subset of the genome,

899
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,970
but it's an important part.

900
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,130
Nonetheless, whether or
not you do exome sequencing

901
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,020
or you do sequencing
of the entire genome,

902
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,590
you have a lot of reads.

903
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:40,180
And so the reads that you
care about are the reads that

904
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,150
are different from reference.

905
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,120
And so you can reduce the
representation of their BAM

906
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,510
file simply by throwing all
the reads on the floor that

907
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,180
don't matter, right?

908
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,100
And so here's an example of
the original BAM file and all

909
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,060
the reads, and what
you do is you just

910
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,730
trim it to only the
variable regions, right?

911
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,340
And so you are
stripping information

912
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:11,940
around the variant regions
out of the BAM file

913
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,790
and things greatly compress
and the downstream processing

914
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:16,965
becomes much more efficient.

915
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,470
OK.

916
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,240
Now let's turn to the
methodological approaches

917
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,770
once we have gotten the
data in as good a form

918
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:32,500
as we possibly can get it, we
have the best quality scores

919
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,930
that we can possibly
come up with,

920
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:40,430
and for every base position,
we have an indication

921
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,160
of how many reads say
that the base is this

922
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,000
and how many reads say
the base is that, OK?

923
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,860
So we have these raw read counts
of the different allelic forms.

924
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,250
And returning to this,
we now can go back

925
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:59,060
and we can attempt
to take these reads

926
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,891
and determine what the
underlying genotypes are

927
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:03,640
for an individual.

928
00:50:06,419 --> 00:50:08,210
Now I want to be clear
about the difference

929
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,810
between a genotype
for an individual

930
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,310
and an allelic spectrum
for a population.

931
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,820
A genotype for an
individual thinks

932
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,570
about both of the alleles
that that individual has,

933
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,830
and they can be phased
or unphased, right?

934
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,400
If they're phased,
it means you know

935
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,460
which allele belongs to mom and
which allele belongs to dad,

936
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,660
so to speak, right?

937
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,580
If they're unphased, you
simply know the number

938
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,360
of reference alleles that
you have in that individual.

939
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,570
Typically, people think about
there being a reference allele

940
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:45,440
and an alternative allele,
which means that a genotype can

941
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,160
be expressed as
0, 1, or 2, which

942
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,680
is the number of
reference alleles

943
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,660
present at a particular base
if it's unphased, right?

944
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,270
0, 1, or 2-- 0 mean there are
no reference alleles there,

945
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,150
1 meaning that it's
a heterozygote,

946
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:05,920
2 mean there are two reference
alleles in that individual.

947
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,692
OK?

948
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:09,900
So there are different ways
of representing genotype,

949
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,610
but once again, it represents
the different allelic forms

950
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,440
of the two chromosomes.

951
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,440
And whatever form you
choose, the probability

952
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,114
over those genotypes
has to sum to 1.

953
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,780
You can think about
the genotype ranging

954
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:31,930
over all the possible bases from
mom and from dad or over 0, 1,

955
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:32,465
and 2.

956
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,590
Doesn't really matter,
depending upon which way you

957
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,970
want to simplify the problem.

958
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:42,200
And what we would like to do
is, for a given population--

959
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,720
let's say cases
or controls-- we'd

960
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,870
like to compute the
probability over the genotypes

961
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:54,410
with high veracity, OK?

962
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:59,200
So in order to do
that, we'll start

963
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,330
by taking all the
reads for each one

964
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:05,025
of the individuals
in a population, OK?

965
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:07,280
And we're going to compute
the genotype likelihoods

966
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,170
for each individual.

967
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,880
So let's talk about
how to do that.

968
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,740
Now everything I've written on
the board is on the next slide.

969
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,760
The problem is, if I
put it on the slide,

970
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,800
it will flash in front
of you and you'll go,

971
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,059
yes, I understand that, I think.

972
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,725
This way, I'll put
it on the board first

973
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:26,810
and you'll look at
it and you'll say,

974
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,765
hm, maybe I don't
understand that, I think.

975
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:30,140
And then you'll
ask any questions

976
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,380
and we can look at the
slide in a moment, OK?

977
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,680
But here's the fundamental
idea, all right?

978
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,420
At a given base in the
genome, the probability

979
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,820
of the reads that we see based
upon the genotype that we think

980
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:48,550
is there can be expressed
in the following form, which

981
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,470
is that we take the product over
all the reads that we see, OK?

982
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:59,322
And the genotype is going to
be a composition of the base we

983
00:52:59,322 --> 00:53:01,280
get from mom and the base
that we get from dad,

984
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,480
or it could simply
be 0, 1, and 2.

985
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,790
We'll put that
aside for a moment.

986
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,850
So what's the chance that
we inherited something

987
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:16,260
from a particular base from mom?

988
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,590
It's this base over
a particular read.

989
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,340
What's the chance
a particular read

990
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,030
came from mom's chromosome?

991
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,830
That's one half
times the probability

992
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:31,930
of the data given
the base that we see.

993
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,840
And once again, since
it could be a coin

994
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,070
flip whether the read came
from mom or dad's chromosome,

995
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:39,710
divide it by 2-- the
probability of the data

996
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,555
that we see with dad's version
of that particular base.

997
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:50,060
So once again, for
all the reads we're

998
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,120
going to compute the
probability of the read set

999
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:56,730
that we see given a particular
hypothesized genotype

1000
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:01,080
by looking at what's the
likelihood or the probability

1001
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,427
of all those reads.

1002
00:54:03,427 --> 00:54:05,010
And for each read,
we don't know if it

1003
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,247
came from mom or from dad.

1004
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:08,580
But in any event, we're going
to compute the probability

1005
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,680
on the next blackboard,
this bit right here.

1006
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,460
OK?

1007
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,306
Yes?

1008
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:17,732
AUDIENCE: So if you assume
that mom and dad have

1009
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:23,547
a different phase at
a particular base,

1010
00:54:23,547 --> 00:54:25,338
couldn't that possibly
skew the probability

1011
00:54:25,338 --> 00:54:28,314
of getting a read from mom's
chromosome or dad's chromosome?

1012
00:54:31,336 --> 00:54:33,434
PROFESSOR: A different phase?

1013
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:39,802
AUDIENCE: So the composition
of bases affect what you get.

1014
00:54:39,802 --> 00:54:45,258
I think certain
base compositions

1015
00:54:45,258 --> 00:54:48,250
are more likely to be
sequenced, for example.

1016
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:48,930
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1017
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,910
AUDIENCE: Could that bias--

1018
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,535
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1019
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:54,720
In fact, that's why on,
I think, the third slide,

1020
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,940
I said non-random genotyping
error was being excluded.

1021
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,292
AUDIENCE: Oh.

1022
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,000
PROFESSOR: Right?

1023
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,010
From our discussion today?

1024
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,510
But you're right that it might
be that certain sequences are

1025
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:07,240
more difficult to
see, but we're going

1026
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,030
to exclude that
for the time being.

1027
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,220
OK?

1028
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,010
So this is the
probability of the reads

1029
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,320
that we see given a
hypothesized genotype.

1030
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,500
And I'll just show you,
that's very simple.

1031
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,390
That we have a read, let's
call the read D sub j,

1032
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,770
and we have the base that
we think we should see.

1033
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,000
And if the base is correct,
then the probability

1034
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,210
that that's correct is 1
minus the error, right,

1035
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,090
that the machine reported.

1036
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,850
And if it isn't
correct, the probability

1037
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:41,350
is just the error at that base
that the machine reported.

1038
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,530
So we're using the error
statistics from the machine

1039
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:48,892
and if it matches what we
expect, it's 1 minus the error.

1040
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,850
And if it doesn't match,
it's just simply going

1041
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,590
to be the error
that's reported, OK?

1042
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,567
So this is the probability of
seeing a particular read given

1043
00:55:57,567 --> 00:55:59,275
a hypothesized base
that should be there.

1044
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,550
Here's how we use that, looking
at all the possible bases that

1045
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:09,540
could be there given a
hypothesized genotype.

1046
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,340
Remember, this genotype is
only going to be one pair.

1047
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,720
It's only going to be AA or
TT or what have you, right?

1048
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,870
So it's going to be one pair.

1049
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:21,170
So we're going to be testing
for either one or two bases

1050
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,270
being present.

1051
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:29,060
And finally, we want to
compute the posterior

1052
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:33,400
of the genotype given the
data we have observed, OK?

1053
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,930
So we want to compute what's
the probability of the genotype

1054
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,779
given the reads that
we have in our hand.

1055
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:41,820
This is really important.

1056
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,540
That is what that genotype
likelihood is up there.

1057
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:51,377
It's the probability of the read
set given the genotype times

1058
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:52,960
the probability of
the genotype-- this

1059
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,286
is a prior-- over the
probability of the data.

1060
00:56:56,286 --> 00:56:57,410
This is simply Bayes' Rule.

1061
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,390
So with this, for
an individual now,

1062
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,150
we can compute the
posterior of the genotype

1063
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,150
given the read set.

1064
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,270
Very simple concept.

1065
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:16,990
So in another form, you can
see the same thing here,

1066
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,960
which is the Bayesian model.

1067
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,630
And we've talked about this
haploid likelihood function,

1068
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:26,880
which was on the
blackboard I showed you.

1069
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,120
And we're assuming all
the reads are independent

1070
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,170
and that they're
going to come equally

1071
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:36,940
from mom and dad, more
or less, et cetera, OK?

1072
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:43,050
And the haploid likelihood
function, once again,

1073
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:47,410
just is using the error
statistics for the machine.

1074
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,525
So I'm asking if the
machine says this is an A

1075
00:57:50,525 --> 00:57:54,900
and I think it's an A, then the
probability that that's correct

1076
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,570
is 1 minus the error
of the machine.

1077
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,870
If the two are not
in agreement, it's

1078
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,250
simply the error in the
machine that I'm using.

1079
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:08,700
So this allows me now to
give a posterior probability

1080
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,320
of a genotype given a
whole bunch of reads.

1081
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,090
And the one part that
we haven't discussed

1082
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,800
is this prior,
which is how do we

1083
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,745
establish what we think is
going on in the population

1084
00:58:25,745 --> 00:58:29,190
and how do we set that?

1085
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:31,960
So if you look back
at the slide again,

1086
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,820
you can see that we
have these individuals

1087
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,920
and there's this magic step
on the right-hand side, which

1088
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,440
is that somehow we're
going to compute

1089
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,660
a joint estimate
across all the samples

1090
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,000
to come up with an estimate
of what the genotypes are

1091
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
in a particular SNP position.

1092
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,660
And the way that we can do
that is with an iterative EM

1093
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,090
procedure-- looks
like this-- so we

1094
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:06,840
can estimate the probability
of the population genotype

1095
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:12,342
iteratively using this
equation until convergence.

1096
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:13,550
And there are various tricks.

1097
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,610
As you'll see if you
want to delve further

1098
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,930
into this in the
paper I posted, there

1099
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,040
are ways to deal with some
of the numerical issues

1100
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,290
and do allele count
frequencies and so forth.

1101
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,860
But fundamentally,
in a population

1102
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,840
we're going to
estimate a probability

1103
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,182
over the genotypes for
a particular position.

1104
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:33,640
And just to keep
it simple, you can

1105
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,780
think about the
genotypes being 0, 1,

1106
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,990
or 2-- 0, no reference
alleles present;

1107
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,980
1, one reference allele present
to that site; 2, two reference

1108
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,182
alleles present
to that site, OK?

1109
00:59:48,182 --> 00:59:49,640
So we get a
probability of each one

1110
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,520
of those states for
that population.

1111
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:00,760
Any questions at all about that?

1112
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,280
The details or anything at all?

1113
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,300
People get the general idea
that what we're just doing

1114
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,900
is we're taking a bunch of
reads at a particular position

1115
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,660
for an individual and
computing the posterior

1116
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,070
probability of a genotype
seeing all of those reads

1117
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:23,970
and then, when we think about
the entire population-- say

1118
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,340
either the cases
or the controls--

1119
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,000
we're computing the
probability over the genotypes

1120
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,430
within that population
using this kind

1121
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,614
of iterative procedure.

1122
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:44,710
OK, so going on then, if
we go back to our 0, 1,

1123
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,260
2 kind of genotype
representation,

1124
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:51,190
we can marginalize psi,
which is the probability

1125
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,195
of the reference allele
being in the population,

1126
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:54,815
and 1 minus psi
being the probability

1127
01:00:54,815 --> 01:00:58,280
of the non-reference allele,
where the capital alleles are

1128
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,870
reference and the little
ones are non-reference.

1129
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:05,870
And then we could also
for epsilon 0, epsilon 1,

1130
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,540
And Epsilon 2, those
are the probabilities

1131
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,820
of the various allelic
forms, the various genotypes.

1132
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,740
And actually, I think
epsilon 0 should be little A,

1133
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,820
little A. Must have
got the two of them

1134
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:23,740
flipped, but it's not
really that important.

1135
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:28,910
OK, so what do we know
about a population?

1136
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,050
Who's heard about
Hardy-Weinberg before?

1137
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,420
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

1138
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,970
OK.

1139
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:38,210
So Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
says that, for example,

1140
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,740
in a population, if the allelic
frequency of the reference

1141
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,810
allele is psi, right, what's
the chance that an individual

1142
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,690
should be AA, big A, big
A, reference, reference?

1143
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,980
In a population?

1144
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,269
Pardon?

1145
01:01:57,269 --> 01:01:58,060
I think I heard it.

1146
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,190
Psi squared, right?

1147
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,640
We're going to assume
diploid organisms,

1148
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,242
we're going to
assume random mating,

1149
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:05,700
we're going to
assume no selection,

1150
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,430
we're going to assume no
bottlenecks, and so forth,

1151
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,110
right?

1152
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:13,826
That over time, the population
will come to its equilibrium

1153
01:02:13,826 --> 01:02:15,300
in the exchange of alleles.

1154
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,780
However, if there's
strong selection

1155
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,460
or if part of the
population gets up and moves

1156
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,030
to a different continent
or something of that sort,

1157
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,920
you can get out of equilibrium.

1158
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,420
And so one question,
whenever you're

1159
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,794
doing a genetic
study like this--

1160
01:02:28,794 --> 01:02:31,320
is your population in
equilibrium or not?

1161
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:37,570
And we have a direct way for
testing for that because we're

1162
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:40,330
actually estimating
the genotypes, right?

1163
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:44,670
So what we can do is this test.

1164
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:48,020
We can do a log likelihood
test directly, right?

1165
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:52,060
And we can compare the
probability of the observed

1166
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:58,090
genotypes-- these are E1 and
E2, where the number indicates

1167
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:02,340
the number of reference
copies-- over the probability

1168
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:08,090
of the genotypes being
composed directly

1169
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:12,980
from the frequency of
the reference allele.

1170
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:17,160
And this will tell
us whether or not

1171
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,330
these are concordant or not.

1172
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,410
And if the Chi-square
value is large enough,

1173
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:26,750
we're going to say that this
divergence couldn't have

1174
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,630
occurred at random and
therefore the population is not

1175
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,255
in equilibrium.

1176
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,570
And you might say,
well, gee, why

1177
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:37,570
do I really care if it's
in equilibrium or not?

1178
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:41,470
I mean, you know,
what relevance does

1179
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:44,500
that have to me when
I'm doing my test?

1180
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,710
Well, here's the issue.

1181
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:51,410
The issue is this-- you're going
to be testing whether or not

1182
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:55,290
genotypes are different
between a case and a control

1183
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,170
population, let's say, OK?

1184
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,670
And you have a couple
different tests you can do.

1185
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,780
The first test is
the test on the top

1186
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,090
and the second test is
the test on the bottom.

1187
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,010
Let's look at the test on
the bottom for a moment, OK?

1188
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:13,580
The test in the bottom
is saying you consider

1189
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:17,630
the likelihood of
the data in group one

1190
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:19,290
and group two
multiplied together

1191
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,830
over the probability of the
data with the groups combined

1192
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:31,430
and you ask whether or not the
increased likelihood-- you're

1193
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:35,750
willing to pay for that given
the two degrees of freedom

1194
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,120
that model implies, right?

1195
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:47,790
Because you have to have two
additional degrees of freedom

1196
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,300
to pay for that in the bottom.

1197
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,760
On the other hand,
in the top, you only

1198
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,510
have one degree of
additional freedom

1199
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:58,050
to pay for the difference in
simply the reference allele

1200
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:00,047
frequency.

1201
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:01,630
And so these are two
different metrics

1202
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,780
you can use to test
for associations

1203
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:08,180
for a particular SNP in two
different case and control

1204
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,200
populations.

1205
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,290
The problem comes is that if the
population is in equilibrium,

1206
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:19,210
then the bottom has too many
degrees of freedom, right?

1207
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,630
Because the bottom,
in some sense,

1208
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,570
can be computed
directly from the top.

1209
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,820
You can compute the epsilons
directly from the size

1210
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,420
if it's in equilibrium.

1211
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,050
So you need to
know whether or not

1212
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,550
you're in equilibrium or not
to figure out what kind of test

1213
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:35,705
to use to see whether or not a
particular SNP is significant.

1214
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:44,130
OK, so just a brief review where
we've come to at this point.

1215
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,220
I've handed you a
basket of reads.

1216
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,650
We're focusing on a particular
location in the genome.

1217
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:53,220
For an individual, we can
look at that basket of reads

1218
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,220
and compute a posterior
probability of the genotype

1219
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,630
at that location.

1220
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,890
We then asked if we take
all of the individuals

1221
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:04,760
in a given interesting
population, like the cases,

1222
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,000
we could compute the
posterior or the probability

1223
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,160
of the genotype over
all those cases.

1224
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,910
We then can take the
cases and the controls

1225
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:19,860
and test for associations using
this likelihood ratio, OK?

1226
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:26,790
So that is the way to go
at the question of SNPs.

1227
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:29,470
And I'll pause here
and see if there

1228
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,839
any other questions about this.

1229
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,680
OK, now there are
lots of other ways

1230
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,640
of approaching
structural variation.

1231
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,080
I said I would touch upon it.

1232
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,320
There is another
method which is--

1233
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,030
we've not been here assigning
what haplotypes to things

1234
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:55,900
or paying attention to
which chromosome or mom

1235
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,420
or dad a particularly
allele came from.

1236
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,150
But suffice to
say-- I'll let you

1237
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,330
read this slide
at your leisure--

1238
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:06,950
the key thing is that, imagine
you have a bunch of reads.

1239
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,730
What you can do in
a particular area

1240
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,230
there's going to
be a variant is you

1241
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,080
can do local assembly
of the reads.

1242
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:17,580
We want to do local assembly
because local assembly handles

1243
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,340
general cases of
structural variation.

1244
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,490
And if you then take
the most likely cases

1245
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:28,360
of the local assembly
supported by reads,

1246
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:33,060
you have the different possible
haplotypes or collections

1247
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:38,180
of bases along the
genome from the assembly.

1248
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:41,330
And we've already talked
about, earlier in class,

1249
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,190
how to take a given
sequence of bases

1250
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,300
and estimate the probability
of the divergence

1251
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,610
from another string.

1252
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,510
So you can estimate
the divergence

1253
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:53,180
of each one of those
assemblies from the reference

1254
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,230
and compute likelihoods, like
we did before for single bases,

1255
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:59,190
although it's
somewhat more complex.

1256
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,060
And so another way
to approach this

1257
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,910
is, instead of asking
about individual bases

1258
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:08,240
and looking at the likelihood
of individual bases,

1259
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,140
you can look at doing
localized assembly of the reads

1260
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,570
that handle
structural variation.

1261
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:23,050
And if you do that,
what happens is

1262
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:29,920
that you can recover
INDEL issues that

1263
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:38,529
appear to call SNP variants that
actually are actually induced

1264
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:44,410
by insertions and deletions
in one of the chromosomes.

1265
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:50,510
So as you can see, as things
get more sophisticated

1266
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,779
in the analysis of
human genome data,

1267
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:54,720
one needs a variety
of techniques,

1268
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,830
including local assembly,
to be able to recover

1269
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,500
what's going on.

1270
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,229
Because of course,
the reference genome

1271
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:02,680
is only an approximate
idea of what's

1272
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,640
there and is being
used as a scaffold.

1273
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:13,649
So we've already talked
about the idea of phasing,

1274
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,790
and we talked about why phasing
is important, especially

1275
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:22,479
when we're trying to
recover whether or not

1276
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,750
you have a loss of
function event, right?

1277
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:28,819
And so the phasing
part of genomics

1278
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:32,529
right now is highly
heuristic, relies partly

1279
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:37,090
upon empirical data from
things like the HapMap Project

1280
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,090
and is outside the
scope of what we're

1281
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,840
going to talk about,
because we could talk

1282
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,529
about phasing for
an entire lecture.

1283
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:44,880
But suffice it to
say, it's important.

1284
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,300
And if you look at
what actually goes on,

1285
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,770
here's a trio, mom,
dad, and the daughter.

1286
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,990
You can see down at the
bottom, you see mom's reads.

1287
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,340
And you see dad actually
has two haplotypes.

1288
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,210
He got one haplotype
from one of his parents

1289
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:02,580
and the other haplotype
from both of his parents.

1290
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:09,410
And then the daughter actually
has the haplotype number one

1291
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:13,510
from dad and no haplotype
number one from mom.

1292
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:17,500
So you can see how these
blocks of mutations

1293
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:24,400
are inherited through the
generation in this form.

1294
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:31,740
And finally, if you
look at a VCF file,

1295
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:36,140
if you see a
vertical bar, that's

1296
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:43,410
telling you that the
chromosomal origin is fixed.

1297
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,890
So it tells you, for
example, in this case,

1298
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,390
the one where the
arrow's pointed to

1299
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,680
is that variant
number one, which

1300
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,680
is the alternative
variant T came from mom

1301
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,120
and a T came from dad.

1302
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,370
So VCF, when it has
slashes between the two

1303
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:05,190
different alleles of a
genotype is unphased,

1304
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:08,100
but you can actually have
a phased VCF version.

1305
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,500
And so there's a whole
phase in the GATK tool kit

1306
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,380
that does phasing.

1307
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,390
And finally, we get
through all this,

1308
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:21,970
the question is how important
are the variants you discover?

1309
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:24,970
And so there's a
variant analysis phase

1310
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:28,160
and it will go through and
annotate all the variants.

1311
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:33,410
For example, this is a
splice site acceptor variant

1312
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,120
which is in a
protein coating gene

1313
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,240
and it's thought
to be important.

1314
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,110
And so at the end
of this pipeline,

1315
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,693
what's going to
happen is you're going

1316
01:11:42,693 --> 01:11:46,090
to be spitting out not
only the variants but,

1317
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:48,960
for some of them, what
their annotated function is.

1318
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,500
OK, so that ends the
part of our lecture

1319
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,840
where we're talking about
how to process raw read data.

1320
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:03,922
And I encourage you to look
at the GATK and other websites

1321
01:12:03,922 --> 01:12:05,630
to actually look at
the state of the art.

1322
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:11,000
But as you can see, it's
an evolving discipline

1323
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,170
that has a kernel of principal
probabilistic analysis in part

1324
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:22,749
of its core surrounded by
a whole lot of baling wire,

1325
01:12:22,749 --> 01:12:24,040
right, to hold it all together.

1326
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,870
And you get the
reads marshalled,

1327
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:31,510
organized, compressed,
aligned properly, phased,

1328
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:36,000
and so forth, OK?

1329
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,830
Let's talk now about how
to prioritize variants.

1330
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:44,160
And I just wanted to show you
a very beautiful result that

1331
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:50,620
is represented by this paper,
which came out very recently.

1332
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:54,990
And here is a portion
of the genome.

1333
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:59,090
And we're looking
here at-- you see

1334
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:06,470
here-- a pancreatic disorder.

1335
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:09,340
And there is an enhancer
on the right-hand side

1336
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,180
of the screen where that
little red square is.

1337
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:16,860
And recall that we said that
certain histone marks were

1338
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:19,340
present typically
over active enhancers.

1339
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,090
And so you can see the
H3K4 mono-methyl mark being

1340
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,030
present over that little
red box as well as

1341
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:30,380
the binding of two pancreatic
regulators, FoxA2 and Pdx1.

1342
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,672
And within that
enhancer you can see

1343
01:13:32,672 --> 01:13:34,630
there are a whole lot of
variants being called.

1344
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:35,390
Well, not a whole lot.

1345
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:36,690
There are actually
five different variants

1346
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:37,430
being called.

1347
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:41,260
And in addition to those
five specific SNP variants,

1348
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,490
there's also another
variation that was observed

1349
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:47,100
in the population of a 7.6-kb
deletion right around that

1350
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,140
enhancer.

1351
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:55,410
And if you look at the
inheritance of those mutations

1352
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:58,110
with disease
prevalence, you can see

1353
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:01,415
that there's a very
marked correlation.

1354
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:06,070
That when you inherit
these variants,

1355
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:09,450
you get this Mendelian disorder.

1356
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:11,170
So it's a single
gene disorder really.

1357
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:20,270
And in order to confirm this,
what the authors of this study

1358
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:23,980
did was they took
that enhancer and they

1359
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:28,740
looked at all the different
SNPs and they mutated it.

1360
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,860
And in the upper
left-hand corner,

1361
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:36,230
you can see that the five little
asterisks note the decrease

1362
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:42,160
in activity of that
enhancer when they mutated

1363
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,440
the bases indicated
at SNP positions.

1364
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,760
The three C's on the
panel on the right

1365
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,370
with the y-axis being
relative interaction

1366
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:53,280
shows that that
enhancer is interacting

1367
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,290
with the promoter of that gene.

1368
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,880
And they further
elucidated the motifs

1369
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,240
that were being interacted with
and the little arrows point

1370
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,680
to where the mutations
in those motifs occur.

1371
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,180
So they've gone
from an association

1372
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:16,540
with that particular disease
to the actual functional

1373
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,760
characterization
of what's going on.

1374
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,380
I'll leave you with a final
thought to think about.

1375
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,587
This is the thing
that caused the brawls

1376
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,920
in the bars I told you about
at the beginning of today's

1377
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,700
lecture.

1378
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,920
Let's suppose you look
at identical twins,

1379
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,270
monozygotic twins, and you
ask the following question.

1380
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,050
You say, OK, in
monozygotic twins,

1381
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:43,180
the prevalence of a particular
disease is a 30% correlative.

1382
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,860
That is, if one individual
in a twin has the disease,

1383
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,300
there's a 30% chance that the
other twin's going to get it.

1384
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,940
Now there are two
possibilities here,

1385
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:56,504
which is that for
all pairs of twins,

1386
01:15:56,504 --> 01:15:58,670
there's a very low risk
that you're going to get it,

1387
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:03,150
or that there are some
subset of genotypes where

1388
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:07,180
if one twin has it, the other
one's always going to get it.

1389
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,320
So the author of the
study actually looked

1390
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,110
at a block of identical twin
data and asked two questions.

1391
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:17,960
The first was if you look at
the percentage of cases that

1392
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,020
would test positive, making
no assumptions about genotype,

1393
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,929
using twin data, you
can see the percentage

1394
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:27,720
of people that actually
have a disease that

1395
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,000
will test positive
is actually fairly

1396
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,320
low for a wide
variety of diseases.

1397
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,210
All these diseases were
studied in the context

1398
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:38,410
of identical twins.

1399
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:43,560
And this suggested to
them that, in fact,

1400
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,500
personal genomic
sequencing might not

1401
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:50,540
be as predictive
as one might like.

1402
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:54,690
That is, if you have a disease,
for over half of these,

1403
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:58,260
the test will not be positive.

1404
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:02,170
And furthermore, if you test
negative for the disease,

1405
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:03,990
your relative risk--
that is, the chance

1406
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:06,590
you're going to get this
disease to the chance you get it

1407
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:11,950
at random in the population--
is not really reduced that much.

1408
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:15,960
And so, since this study
relied solely on twin data

1409
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,150
and didn't make any
other assumptions,

1410
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:22,610
it raised the question in
the field of to what extent

1411
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:26,070
is personal genome sequencing
going to be really helpful?

1412
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,410
So on that note, we've
talked a lot today

1413
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:32,440
about the analysis of
human genetic variation.

1414
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,980
I hope you've enjoyed it.

1415
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:38,457
Once again, on Thursday
we have Ron Weiss coming.

1416
01:17:38,457 --> 01:17:39,290
Thank you very much.

1417
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:42,432
This concludes lecture 20 of the
formal material in the course

1418
01:17:42,432 --> 01:17:43,640
and we'll see you in lecture.

1419
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,790
Thank you very much.
